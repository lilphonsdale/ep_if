# Looking at pilot program results  

In this notebook, we review the results of a pilot program where students have been using technology to assist with their English learning. 

The data has been cleaned in google sheets and then exported as a csv. It is read into the notebook so that the analysis can be performed with pandas.

The data is filtered to compare the schools in the pilot program with those outside of the pilot program. We look at the average test scores for each cohort. We also look at how the schools in the pilot performed in the years before and after the pilot.

This chart shows us how each of the school's in the pilot performed in each year:

This chart shows just how much one school's improvement stands out from the others:
